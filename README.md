## Support
This script is was created for Firefox and only Firefox, not Chrome, not Opera, and not Vivaldi, alternate browser support relies on users reporting errors.

I'm at a dilema when it comes to browsers, for now Firefox remains the official standard, though it might switch to Chrome.

This script was made for Violentmonkey, though may work on other extensions, if you use Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey, I suggest switching, though it's not required. Greasemonkey users beware, it is the cause of many compatability issues.

Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, & Safari, all experience issues on other games, and so I do not support them.

No support is provided to older versions, only the latest releases, this includes older versions of browsers and extensions.
